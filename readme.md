This repository contains the final project from the **Social Robotics** course at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**. It is a prototype built under tight time constraints — many parts are experimental, incomplete, or not fully polished — but it illustrates the core ideas explored in the course.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to build a basic interview system using a Furhat social robot, combining robot control with simple multimodal behavior analysis and question handling. This is *not* production-ready software — the focus was on experimentation and learning.
